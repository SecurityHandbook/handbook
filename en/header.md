Computer security is nowadays a very important, yet shockingly underestimated, topic – most likely due to insufficient education of the general public. People usually don't understand why they should care. **Security** is an ubiquitous factor in our lives. But most people only see one of its aspects – physical security. A person doesn't climb mountains without climbing gear and sufficient protection, because they see and are fully aware of possible fatal consequences. However, what a person often fails to see is that underestimated and neglected computer security may have similarly fatal consequences.

Our society today already relies on computer systems and smart devices to a significant extent, and the extent will only grow in the future. Water treatment systems, smart cars, home security systems, military, finance management, communication,&#8230; Should a water treatment facility fall victim to a successful attack, the they'd effectively be able to poison a whole city. Should a smart car fall victim to a successful attack, consequences would be lethal. But even in case of hacking a personal device, consequences of sensitive data leakage might be disastrous as well. For these reasons, **it's essential we all accept computer security as a factor in our everyday lives** and assign its importance onto the same level as physical security.

No device can ever be 100% secure as there are many variables in the process (physical security, HW, SW, user comfort,&#8230;). Security's about compromises. In the following handbook's chapters we'll strive for most effective security with minimum user comfort loss.
