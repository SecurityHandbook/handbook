Computer security is a very important topic these days, yet shockingly underestimated. Most people don't understand why they should care.

Security is an essential factor of our lives, everyone considers security all the time &ndash; their physical security. You don't climb a mountain without climbing protection because you're fully aware of the risks and possible negative outcomes. People fail to see or simply don't want to see how much we depend on smart devices each day. Water treatment, smart cars, smart fridges, security systems, finance management, communication,... However, abuse of these things can have the same fatal outcome as climbing the mountain without protection. Therefore, it's important we accept computer security as a factor of our everyday life and treat it the same way we treat physical security.

No device can be 100% secure as there're too many factors &ndash; physical security, HW, SW, user comfort etc. Security's always about making a compromise. In this handbook we'll try to achieve maximum security with minimum loss of user comfort.

Handbook is regularly updated twice a year. Updates can be delayed &ndash; please note that this project is a leisure time activity &ndash; and don't necessarily have to bring visible changes to all chapters.
