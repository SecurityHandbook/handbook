## Security basics:
- Periodically backup your data.

![password_strength_sm](https://faq.mople71.cz/img/en/passwd.png)</li>
- Use a different password for each service, consider using a [password manager](#basics8).
- Avoid connecting to unknown/unsafe networks, or at least don't send any personal data through them and avoid using unsafe protocols (HTTP, FTP atc.). Ideally use a VPN.
- Pay attention to what data you enter where &ndash; selling personal data is a highly profitable business.
- Don't forget the physical security factor &ndash; lock your device, set a UEFI password, disable boot menu etc.

## Surfing securely:
- Use a securely configured web browser (see other FAQ chapters).
- Consider using a separate browser for personal things (e.g. online banking).
- Don't visit unknown/untrusted sites and never download any files from them.
- Reduce visiting 18+ sites as it's quite common for them to be a victim of malwaretising and serve malicious code.
- Don't use social buttons outside the specific social network as these buttons can be trivially mimicked.
- Avoid the **short URLs** &ndash; like https://bit.ly/tinyurlwiki etc. They can easily mask dangerous links.
- Refrain from using unsafe network SW such as <span class="red">Flash Player</span> or <span class="red">Java</span>, their exploitation is popular and very common. At minimum, disable it inside your browser.
- Only open email attachments from trusted senders.
- If you suspect a file to be malicious, always scan it before opening with e.g.  [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).

<div class="alert success"><p><img src="https://mople71.cz/img/success.png" alt="success"> <strong>Tip</strong><br>
The safest way to browse the web: <span class="green">securely configured live OS</span>. However, it should be pointed out that this option doesn't have to be 100% safe as well &ndash; for example the EFI can be infected if the device has been hacked in the past.</p></div>

## Using mobile devices securely:
- Use an updated, patched and **original** OS version.
- Don't *root* / *jailbreak* your device &ndash; such action breaks the security model of mobile OSs.
- Install apps only from trusted sources &ndash; *Google Play, F-Droid* / *Apple Store* / *Microsoft Store*.
- Refrain from installing apps requiring unreasonable permissions (someting like Flashlight+ demanding access to SMS and contacts).
- Perform risky activities exclusively under a Guest account.
- Don't forget the physical security factor &ndash; lock your device, don't unlock the bootloader etc.
